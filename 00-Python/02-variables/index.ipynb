    "In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value. Unlike many other programming languages, **Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type. The type of the variable is `inferred` based on the value assigned.**\n",

    "To use variables effectively, we must follow Pythonâ€™s naming rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names can only contain `letters, digits and underscores` (`_`).\n",
    "* A variable name `cannot` start with a `digit`.\n",
    "* Variable names are `case-sensitive` (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).\n",
    "* Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.\n"
